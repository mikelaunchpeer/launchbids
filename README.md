## Quick Install

In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run the application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

The application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The application should be running. 


## Deploying To Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform-as-a-service (PaaS).  The MEANJS project
can easily be deployed to any Cloud Foundry instance.  The easiest way to deploy the
MEANJS project to Cloud Foundry is to use a public hosted instance.  The two most popular
instances are [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/) and
[IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net).  Both provide free trials and support pay-as-you-go models
for hosting applications in the cloud.  After you have an account follow the below steps to deploy MEANJS.

* Install the [Cloud Foundry command line tools](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html).
* Now you need to log into Cloud Foundry from the Cloud Foundry command line.
  *  If you are using Pivotal Web Services run `$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`.
  *  If you are using IBM Bluemix run `$ cf login -a api.ng.bluemix.net`.
* Create a Mongo DB service.
+  *  If you are using Pivotal Web Services run `$ cf create-service mongolab sandbox mean-mongo`
+  *  If you are using IBM Bluemix run `$ cf create-service mongodb 100 mean-mongo`
* Clone the GitHub repo for MEANJS if you have not already done so
  * `$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git && cd mean`
* Run `$ npm install`
* Run the Grunt Build task to build the optimized JavaScript and CSS files
  * `$ grunt build`
* Deploy MEANJS to Cloud Foundry
  * `$ cf push`

After `cf push` completes you will see the URL to your running MEANJS application 
(your URL will be different).

    requested state: started
    instances: 1/1
    usage: 128M x 1 instances
    urls: mean-humbler-frappa.mybluemix.net

Open your browser and go to that URL and your should see your MEANJS app running!

###  Deploying MEANJS To IBM Bluemix
IBM Bluemix is a Cloud Foundry based PaaS.  By clicking the button below you can signup for Bluemix and deploy
a working copy of MEANJS to the cloud without having to do the steps above.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeanjs%2Fmean)

After the deployment is finished you will be left with a copy of the MEANJS code in your own private Git repo
in Bluemix complete with a pre-configured build and deploy pipeline.  Just clone the Git repo, make your changes, and
commit them back.  Once your changes are committed, the build and deploy pipeline will run automatically deploying
your changes to Bluemix.
